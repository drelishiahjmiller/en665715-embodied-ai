"""Mission tools: camera + movement in one step, with the safety rules in the code.

A planning model given only low-level tools (look, turn, drive) often skips steps:
it drives without looking, or invents a destination. These tools keep the rules
in Python, so they hold no matter which model plans:

    drive_forward_if_clear(meters)  takes a photo first; refuses if anything is ahead
    search_for(target)              look, turn 45 degrees left, look again, up to a full circle
    approach(target)                turn toward the target and drive in short steps,
                                    looking before every step, until it looks large

Each tool asks for your approval once before it starts moving.
