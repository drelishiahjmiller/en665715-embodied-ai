"""ROSA agent that sees with the camera and moves with the fused position estimate.

Run inside the container while the sensor fusion launch and the vision launch are
running (Gazebo or the real robot):
    python3 /workspace/vision/vision_agent.py

Two models, both served by Ollama on your computer:
    OLLAMA_MODEL  (default llama3.2)  plans and calls the tools (this agent)
    VISION_MODEL  (default gemma4)    reads the photos (vision_node.py)

Two tool sets (AGENT_TOOLS):
    mission (default)  search_for, approach, drive_forward_if_clear: the safety rules
                       live in the tools, so the planner only picks the next step
    basic              look, turn, drive_distance, go_to: the planner must follow the
                       whole procedure itself (compare the two in Exercise 4)

Example requests:
    What do you see?
    Is the path ahead clear?
    Drive forward 0.5 meters.
    Find the red ball and drive to it.
